# ScrumBoard
The aim of this project is to automate the scrum standup process and to expose appropriate scrum metrics to the appropriate audience which can be used to streamline/tweak the existing sprint/kanban/XP procedures for the team for optimal performance and throughput

Apart from the regular standup notes, this portal helps the team capture their blockers, meeting hours, gain a better and more lasting visibility into where the team stands w.r.t their deliverables. It provides intuitive metrics on a personal, team and org (department) level visible to appropriate audience which can help them take appropriate decisions/communicate to Customers etc.;

Many teams use personal Scrum boards to do the same. Problem - You do not have track of more than a day(s) data (or may be a week(s)) Some teams have scrum masters sending out emails of the daily standup notes. That doesn't scale very well, scrum master should be one heck of a note taker. 

This application puts the onus on the team to update the notes, at at their own pace and level of detail. Of course accountability cab be imposed too, given the Manager/Scrum Master/ teal Lead/ TPM can keep a track of who has updated for the day and who hasn't (not to mention, can see the updates)

More on this soon...
